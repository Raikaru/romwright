## Ghidra-compatible formats and algorithms

`ventris-sleigh` implements the compiled-SLEIGH container, packed marshal
records, constructor decisions and context actions, and p-code templates
described by Ghidra 12.1.3 source. The compatibility reference is upstream tag
`Ghidra_12.1.3_build`, commit
`8b4c91d4d5bd1549622bfbade0df199585b98365`, primarily
`decompile/cpp/slaformat.cc`, `marshal.cc`, `slghpattern.cc`,
`slghpatexpress.cc`, `slghsymbol.cc`, `semantics.cc`, `context.cc`, and
`sleigh.cc`. Ghidra is licensed under Apache-2.0.

The bundled x86, ARM, AArch64, MIPS, PowerPC, RISC-V, 68020, SuperH, 6502,
and Z80 `.sla` files were built by that Ghidra release from its Apache-2.0
processor sources. The bundled `ppc_gekko_broadway.sla` was built with Ghidra
12.1.3 from Apache-2.0 Cuyler36/Ghidra-GameCube-Loader commit
`921504c9ddba6e8d9b3655b665a60f1a33306220`; its SHA-256 is
`aa25bde9ffb8f6366e1e490c6a488b1aced4665dc6c4f2fdca9cc598d5530975`.
The bundled `spu.sla` was built with Ghidra 12.1.3 from Apache-2.0
aerosoul94/GhidraSPU commit
`b85076dcecf30cf9db6ada506d69dd64972a00d7`; its SHA-256 is
`9c04f6f759962855c2f406a9f812cc886c621c634b3b5768ca350b6f67944d08`.
The bundled `r5900.sla` was built with Ghidra 12.1.3 from Apache-2.0
chaoticgd/ghidra-emotionengine-reloaded release `v2.1.36`, commit
`44fdb01a08d15a562308e79651203879d454bd8e`; its SHA-256 is
`703cc84a67b4a049e5a6e3d258975fb1e4ea27f024968bb6397cf57095418c6c`. Ghidra's
own MIPS languages do not decode the R5900's multimedia or COP2/VU macro-mode
instructions.

## Vendored Ghidra decompiler sources and type data

`third_party/ghidra/decompiler/` is Ghidra 12.1.3's
`Ghidra/Features/Decompiler/src/decompile/cpp` verbatim - 237 source files and
its `Makefile`, unmodified. `tools/build_native.py` builds two programs from it:
`ghidra_opt`, which is the same program Ghidra ships as
`Features/Decompiler/os/<platform>/decompile`, and `sleigh_opt`, the SLEIGH
compiler. Ventris drives the first over the `ghidra_process` protocol and uses
the second to compile language data. Neither program is patched, and
`tools/vendor_ghidra.py --verify` re-hashes every vendored byte against
`third_party/ghidra/MANIFEST.sha256` so that an edit to Ghidra's C++ is a build
failure rather than a review comment.

`grammar.cc` and `xml.cc` are the bison and flex outputs Ghidra ships alongside
their `.y` sources; they are vendored as shipped so a build neither needs those
tools nor rewrites a vendored file.

`third_party/ghidra/languages/` is language *source* only - `.slaspec`, `.sinc`,
`.pspec`, `.cspec`, `.ldefs`, `.opinion` - from Ghidra's MIPS processor and from
the two Apache-2.0 extensions named above. The compiled `.sla` files are build
products and are not vendored.

`third_party/ghidra/typeinfo/generic_clib.gdt` is Ghidra's C library type
archive, copied as-is. It is data, not source: Ghidra applies its prototypes to
functions by name, so reproducing Ghidra's output requires the same data.

Ghidra is licensed under Apache-2.0, which permits this redistribution with
attribution.

`tools/diff_ghidra.py` optionally compares Ventris output against a separately
installed Ghidra 12.1.3. The official release archive has SHA-256
`93a5d11a9ad510622acaaf908c556a7b9b764d338e78a7567f3689bf5081fd54`.

## Runtime crates

`ventris-sleigh` uses `miniz_oxide` (MIT OR Zlib OR Apache-2.0) to inflate the
zlib payload in compiled `.sla` files. Its transitive `adler2` dependency is
licensed under 0BSD OR MIT OR Apache-2.0.

## Optional corpus metadata

Development-only corpus checks consume source-backed metadata so maintainers
can reproduce smoke checks against images they obtained independently. The
repository does not ship those images or copied game source. Each entry records
its source commit and the license value observed for the source project:

| Project | Metadata use | Recorded license | Distribution boundary |
|---|---|---|---|
| `n64decomp/perfect_dark` | N64 symbols and function addresses | MIT | Metadata only; no ROM or source bundled |
| `ACreTeam/ac-decomp` | GameCube symbols and function addresses | CC0-1.0 | Metadata only; no image or source bundled |
| `crowded-street/3s-decomp` | PS2 symbols and function addresses | AGPL-3.0 | Metadata only; no image or source bundled |
| `pret/pokeemerald` | GBA symbols and function addresses | unspecified | Metadata only; no ROM or source bundled |

The `unspecified` value is intentional. It must not be changed to a guessed
license, and a release must not add the referenced ROM or source without a
separate provenance and redistribution review.

## Build-time tools

The VS Code integration uses development-only npm packages listed in
`integrations/vscode/package-lock.json`. They are not included in the runtime
